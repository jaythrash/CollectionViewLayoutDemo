#CollectionView Layouts Demo

Sample iOS app to demonstrate how to customize CollectionViewFlowLayout and CollectionViewLayout. This app accompanied my talk ["Living off the Grid with UICollectionViews"](https://speakerdeck.com/jaythrash/living-off-the-grid-with-uicollectionviews) at 360iDev 2013.

##BookShelf Layout
Example of a customized UICollectionViewFlowLayout which uses Supplimentary Views (Section Headers) and Decoration Views (the book shelves)

##Passbook Layout
Example of a customized UICollectionViewLayout based on the iOS Passbook.app. CollectionView cells are displayed as a stacked deck of "cards" and tapping a card will shuffle it to the top of the screen while simultaneously moving the other cards to a stack at the bottom of the screen.
